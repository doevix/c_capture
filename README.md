# Capture thing
Just a little thing written in C used for capturing input.
Input strings and then hit ENTER. Then enter an empty line to finish capturing.
Displays lines input.

This fills up a linked list and its elements then get moved over to an array of strings. I just made this because a lot of the time I need an input of this style.

Build with `gcc -o bin/capture capture.c main.c`
